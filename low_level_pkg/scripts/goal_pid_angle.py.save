Key Additions

    PID Parameters:
        For linear velocity: linear_kp, linear_ki, linear_kd.
        For angular velocity: angular_kp, angular_ki, angular_kd.

    PID Calculations:
        Proportional (P): The current error.
        Integral (I): Sum of past errors (scaled by time).
        Derivative (D): Rate of change of the error (difference between current and last error).

    Time Delta (delta_time):
        Ensures that the integral and derivative calculations are time-sensitive.

    Error Management:
        Separate errors and computations for linear and angular velocities.

Benefits of PID

    The integral term helps correct steady-state errors.
    The derivative term improves stability and prevents overshooting.

You can tune the ki and kd
